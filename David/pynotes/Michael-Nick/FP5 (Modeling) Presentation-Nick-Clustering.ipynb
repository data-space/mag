    "## First, what is clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning in the ML world. The main difference between supervised and unsupervised methods is that supervised learning takes place based on a set of training data labeled with the value of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning happens with unlabeled data points and the goal is to organize the data in a certain way as to explain it's structure. Examples include dimmensionality reduction, clustering and association rule learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering = assigning a set of observations into sub groups called clusters so that the sub groups contain observations which are in some way similar to each other."
