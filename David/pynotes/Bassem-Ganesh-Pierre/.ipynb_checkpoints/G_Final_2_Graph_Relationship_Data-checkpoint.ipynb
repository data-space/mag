    "# Reiterating the Goal \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid any loss of continuity, before describing why specific relationships are gathered from the master dataframe, it is imperative that the goal from the perspective of __song recommendation__ using graphs, and the approach, is reiterated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a `track`-`track` network graph with appropriate weights that will help in song recommendation, based on shortest-distance algorithms for networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to achieve the goal are explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Graph with the nodes being `track`, `artist_id` and `artist_terms`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be the most obvious graph, based on the master MSS data, which will have the following relationships (or edges).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `track` - `artist_id`: with attributes being `artist_familiarity`, `artist_hotttness` and `song_hotttness`\n",
    "2. `artist_id` - `artist`: with attributes being `artist_wt` and `artist_freq`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remove the `artist_id` and `artist_terms` nodes and replace with appropriate relationships between `track` nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "A `track` - `track` relationship network graph is the end goal. In the graph with all the three types of nodes, two tracks will always be connected via `artist_id` node and `artist_terms` node. There will be no case where two tracks will be directly connected. The exhaustive case examples below explain it better.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Two tracks by the same artist will be connected through the common `artist_id` node.\n",
    "+ Two tracks by different artists will be connected through the common `artist_terms` nodes between the two `artist_id` nodes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - No common artist terms:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    There will be no path between the two tracks, without a third `artist_id` being involved which has atleast one common term with each of the artists. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `n` common artist terms:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    There will be `n` paths between the two tracks. Each path (undirected) will be consisting of the following nodes, in that order: track1--artist1--artist_term--artist2--track2.\n",
    "        \n",
    "The sequential approach will be described in the sections that follow, in this notebook.\n"

    "# Graph Relationship Data from MSS Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "The master dataframe created in the notebook `G_Final_1_Data_Creation_From_H5DF.ipynb`, from the MSS metadata, is used to deduce the relationships that exists between the following combination of fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ __`track` - `artist_id`__\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is a straightforward relationship from the master dataframe. For each `track`, there will be one and only one `artist_id`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "+ __`artist_id` - `artist_terms`__\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is another relatively straightforward relationship to deduce from the master dataframe. For each `artist_id` there will be more than one `artist_terms`. But each row of the master dataframe represents one such relationship.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "+ __`artist_id` - `artist_id`__\n",
    "\n",
    "    There will be more than one relationship between two artists, via the common artist terms. In order to reduce these multiple relationships (or multiple paths) between a pair of artists to a single relationship with tha appropriate strength, a self-join of the master dataframe with itself on `artist_terms` is required.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "+ __`track` - `track`__\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since the final goal is to reduce the graph to a `track` to `track` relationship graph, deducing this relationship is critical. Again, it is done using a self-join of the master dataframe with itself. Since, a song is connected to only one artist directly, the reduction of `artist_id` - `artist_id` relationships to a single relationship is equivalent to reducing the `track` - `track` paths to a single path. Hence, only `track` - `track` relationship deduction will be described in detail later in this notebook, following which the `artist_id` - `artist_id` relationship will be deduced similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since building and analyzing a graph is computationally very intense, data from a random subset of __500 tracks__ is used. The following sections describe the sequence of steps, starting with the master MSS metadata, to arrive at the `track`-`track` relationship data."

Each row of the data frame represents the connection between two tracks, with the appropriate aggregated attributes.
