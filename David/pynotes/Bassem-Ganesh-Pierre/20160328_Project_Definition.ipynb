    "Build a graph (network) with the following as the nodes.\n",

    "- Artist (Artist ID)\n",

    "\n",
    "The *goal* is to *establish a relationship (link) between the songs* (there will never be a direct relationship) using the known relationships between the other nodes. For example, each song will be related to an artist. And a song can be related to another song through the relationship shared between the artists, which in turn can be through artist_terms, similar_artist or the exact same artist for the two songs. Also two songs can be related using the year of release. The possible relationship levels between two songs are provided below, in order of weightage (initial idea).\n",

    "Once the graph is built, we will be able to build a relationship between songs as described above (and the weights of these relationships will be based on some rule-based scores). Once we have that, we can actually eliminate all of the other nodes and only have the Songs (track_id) nodes and the relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then get a dataframe with *Track_ID1*, *Track_ID2* and the *Weight_Relationship* as the three columns. So, based on these relationship weights, song recommendation is possible. For example, if the first song is some track_id *TR123*, \n",
    "\n",
    "    + We pull all the rows where Track_ID1 or Track_ID2 is TR123\n",
    "    + Identify the distinct relationships, basically dedup.\n",
    "    + Rank order based on the scores (relationship weights or can be thought of as distance).\n",
    "    + The top 5 or 10 songs will be the recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, we can also use the measures of a graph to identify the clusters and compare them with the clusters we get from other techniques. The approach here is still not very clear."
